                Amy is Quite the Quirky Character!

            <p>
            I'm a 20-something-year-old pursuing a degree in <b>Software Development</b>
            through BYU Pathway Worldwide. When I'm not puzzling over the arcane 
            arts of HTML and Python, I like drawing cutesy cartoon bugs, writing 
            fiction about finding hope in hard times, and making comics about all
            sorts of things-- everything from the miracles of daily life to
            adventures set in imaginary worlds.  
        </p>
        <p>
            While I'm only a student at the moment, I plan to become an <b>application
            developer</b> for my career. I also plan to apply the knowledge I gain over
            the course of my education to make simple, wholesome <b>video games</b> that
            pass on important messages rooted in Gospel truth.
