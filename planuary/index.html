            <p>Hi! My name is Goobiedoo, and I’m the artist behind Goobiedoodles. I spent years of my life wanting to start a webcomic but feeling too intimidated to begin working on it. Have you ever felt the same? So many people are inspired by their favorite Webtoons and dream of one day creating their magnum opus— they dedicate hours to daydreaming about it, putting together perfected playlists and immaculate moodboards, but never putting pen to paper. Are you scared to commit to one idea when you have so many good ones? Are you anxious about whether or not people will like your comic? Are you scared to post your first page? If your answer to any of these is yes, Planuary is here to help.</p>
            <p>Planuary is a January art challenge dedicated to helping you fall in love with your comic idea. With this challenge’s help, you can get working on your comic without scaring yourself off with model sheets and background layouts. It consists of 31 prompts that will build up your premise and cultivate the love you have for your comic idea. It welcomes you to pick and choose which prompts work best for you and throw away the rest— we’re here to have fun with our comics, after all, not turn them into chores!</p> 
            <p>This website has two other pages in addition to this one— the Prompts List page has the complete catalog of prompts for the challenge, and the Tips and Tricks page has inspiration and advice for completing it.</p>
            <p>Good luck, and happy comic making!</p>
