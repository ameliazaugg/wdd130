                <p>First: Curate your art style for speed. If you want to make progress on your comic fast, designing the style it is rendered in to be produced quickly and comfortably is key. If you can make pages fast, you'll be able to see your body of work build up fastâ€” and nothing is more satisfying than printing off a tall stack of pages you drew yourself.</p>
                <p>Second: If you have a plot in mind, write out as much of the story ahead of page production as possible. If you want to create a gag-a-day style comic, script a bunch of jokes ahead of page production as well. This way, you'll be able to know what direction you want to take the comic in if it's a narrative comic and have something to fall back on if you run out of ideas for your gag-a-day comic.</p>
                <p>Finally: Keep your favorite comics close at hand as you develop your idea. What do you like about them? Try to dissect them and figure out what makes them tick. Do you like the character designs of one, and the humor of the other? What about the backgrounds of one and the dialogue of another? See if you can mash all those traits together under the umbrella of your favorite comics genre to make your comic as fun as possible.</p>
