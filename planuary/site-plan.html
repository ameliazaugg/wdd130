      <p>Hi! My name is Goobiedoo, and I’m the artist behind Goobiedoodles. I spent years of my life wanting to start a webcomic but feeling too intimidated to begin working on it. Have you ever felt the same? So many people are inspired by their favorite Webtoons and dream of one day creating their magnum opus— they dedicate hours to daydreaming about it, putting together perfected playlists and immaculate moodboards, but never putting pen to paper. Are you scared to commit to one idea when you have so many good ones? Are you anxious about whether or not people will like your comic? Are you scared to post your first page? If your answer to any of these is yes, Planuary is here to help.</p>
      <p>Planuary is a January art challenge dedicated to helping you fall in love with your comic idea. With this challenge’s help, you can get working on your comic without scaring yourself off with model sheets and background layouts. It consists of 31 prompts that will build up your premise and cultivate the love you have for your comic idea. It welcomes you to pick and choose which prompts work best for you and throw away the rest— we’re here to have fun with our comics, after all, not turn them into chores!</p> 
      <p>This website has two other pages in addition to this one— the Prompts List page has the complete catalog of prompts for the challenge, and the Tips and Tricks page has inspiration and advice for completing it.</p>

      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <p>First: Curate your art style for speed. If you want to make progress on your comic fast, designing the style it is rendered in to be produced quickly and comfortably is key. If you can make pages fast, you'll be able to see your body of work build up fast— and nothing is more satisfying than printing off a tall stack of pages you drew yourself.</p>
      <p>Second: If you have a plot in mind, write out as much of the story ahead of page production as possible. If you want to create a gag-a-day style comic, script a bunch of jokes ahead of page production as well. This way, you'll be able to know what direction you want to take the comic in if it's a narrative comic and have something to fall back on if you run out of ideas for your gag-a-day comic.</p>
      <p>Finally: Keep your favorite comics close at hand as you develop your idea. What do you like about them? Try to dissect them and figure out what makes them tick. Do you like the character designs of one, and the humor of the other? What about the backgrounds of one and the dialogue of another? See if you can mash all those traits together under the umbrella of your favorite comics genre to make your comic as fun as possible.</p>
